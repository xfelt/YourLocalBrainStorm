With the upcoming metaverse technology, i believe it could affect our daily life like our communication tools.
Calls could be as immersive as reality, instead of seeing our interlocutor on the phone screen, he would be integrated in our visual on the glasses or on the contact lenses.
Meeting could happend only by accepting the call by mind. As controls and decision are starting to be operated by brain waves.
